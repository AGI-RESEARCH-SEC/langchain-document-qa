## An Approach to Artificial General Intelligence
### Overview:

Welcome to the research project on "An Approach to Artificial General Intelligence"! This project aims to explore various aspects of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and incorporating insights from the fields of geometry, abstract mathematics, prompt engineering, and brain architecture. This project is open source, and we encourage contributions from the AI community to further advance our understanding of AGI.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this research project are as follows:

#### Experimentation on Large Language Models (LLMs): 
We will conduct experiments on existing LLMs to gain insights into their capabilities and limitations.
By exploring different approaches, fine-tuning techniques, and novel use cases, we aim to push the boundaries of LLMs in terms of understanding, reasoning, 
and generating human-like text.

#### Exploring Geometrical and Abstract Mathematics in LLMs:
Geometry and abstract mathematics offer valuable insights into complex systems, including LLMs. We will investigate the geometric interpretations of LLMs to uncover
hidden patterns, relationships, and structures within their latent space. Additionally, we will explore how abstract mathematical concepts such as category theory, 
graph theory, and information theory can be applied to LLMs.

#### Prompt Engineering Techniques in LLMs: 
Prompts play a crucial role in shaping the behavior and output of LLMs. We will experiment with various prompt
engineering techniques, including conditioning, instruction following, and guided generation, to optimize LLMs for specific tasks, improve controllability,
and mitigate biases.

#### Building a Cognitive Architecture: 
The human brain provides a rich source of inspiration for AGI development. 
We will study the brain's architecture and cognitive processes to build a cognitive architecture that can mimic key aspects of human intelligence. 
This will involve investigating neural network architectures, memory systems, attention mechanisms, and learning algorithms.
