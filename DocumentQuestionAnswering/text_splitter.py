length_function: how the length of chunks is calculated. Defaults to just counting number of characters,
but itâ€™s pretty common to pass a token counter here.

chunk_size: the maximum size of your chunks (as measured by the length function).

chunk_overlap: the maximum overlap between chunks. It can be nice to have some overlap to maintain 
some continuity between chunks (eg do a sliding window).
